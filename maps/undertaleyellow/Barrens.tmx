Needs to be powered by the [[Outpost]] generator, cleand with the [[wet sponge]] and reminded where the [[Glen]] is with the [[amber]] to be able to transport Niko there. Until Niko uses the bed they're too sleepy to proceed.

When the Rowbot is unpowered you get an opportunity to prank Niko by saying you're not here.

On the Solstice route the Rowbot gets covered in squares and asks Niko to not approach it. If it's unpowered Niko comments on the squares.</property>

    <property name="description">Allows Niko to rest and dream. Meeting the [[Prophetbot]] is required to use this bed. Using this bed is required to leave the Barrens.

After the first time sleeping in this bed Niko will have a dream about the wheat field surrounding their home village. Niko will be excited to tell you more about their home and will ask you about yours.

On the Solstice route, Niko doesn't see dreams and can use beds more than once although it's no longer required for anything.</property>

After this point there is no way to terminate the Solstice route. After Silver moves into the server room squares spawn on top of the [[Rowbot]] making the normal route impossible to complete.</property>
