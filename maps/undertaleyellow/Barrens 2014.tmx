When [[Niko]] gets close, [[Prophetbot]] notices the [[lightbulb]] and approaches Niko, excited to answer any questions the savior from the prophecy might have.

Prophetbot can explain (all except &quot;the computer&quot; option are optional and can be skipped with Cancel key):

1) The history and regions of the [[world]] and the spire that housed the old sun.

2) The old and new [[sun]]s, the phosphor that stores their energy, and the reliance of the world on light for survival.

3) The computer saying the name of the [[player]], who is revealed to be the god of the world. The Prophetbot will teach Niko to communicate with the player directly. This presents an opportunity for the player to change their name. Prophetbot will also encourage Niko to look for the player's guidance.

4) Prophetbot doesn't know how Niko can go home, but their mission is to save the world.

After answering the questions Prophetbot wishes Niko luck and starts wandering aimlessly.</property>
